***2D constructions***

in between gith given ratio
points to become spheres
lines, rays, segments
tangents to circle from a point
tangents to any curve, for example ellipse (use align to normal in shrinkwrap)
orthogonality
measure angles, lengths, areas
transformations:
    reflections about line or point
    move along a direction for given length 
    homothesia
    inversion
    rotation about a point
